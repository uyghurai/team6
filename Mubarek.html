        <h1>What you should know about me</h1> 
    <p>Hi teamates, my name is Mubarek, i am 12 years old girl and in grade 7.
       I live in BC Vancover, and started coding just about last year.
       At first i really did not like coding and found it very frustrating but time went by i found
       it a bit and bit more fun. Then started to like it and understand it way much more , but i still find 
       it kind of challenging at times. Now that we have started github and get to do things more collaboratively, i hope
       to get to know you better and work well.
    </p>
